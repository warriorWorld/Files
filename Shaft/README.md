# Shaft
A shaft game, want to challenge the -100 floor?

You can download this game on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.harbinger.shaft)

I used Unity to develop this game, the game's target is to reach the final floor. In the game, it has 9 characters, all those characters have their own special ability. For example, the Spider can shoot a thread, the Time can stop time, and the Space can flash.

When you arrive on the 100 floor, your character's ability will change permanently.
